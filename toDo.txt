TODO:
	Actual start the interactive play part.
ISSUES:
	checking validity of the map's symbols doesn't work right now, so I disabled it, 	will fix later
	the clearscreen \f symbol ain't work on console, but that doesn't really matter, and I don't want to implement some turrible hack to of like 20 newlines to clear the screen. It's fine, I won't need that once I move to Swing anyways.
